        There is a place where the sidewalk ends and before the street begins,
        and there the grass grows soft and white, and there the sun burns
        crimson bright, and there the moon-bird rests from his flight to cool in
        the peppermint wind. Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
        and the dark street winds and bends. Past the pits where the asphalt
        flowers grow we shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow and
        watch where the chalk-white arrows go to the place where the sidewalk
        ends. Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow, and we'll go
        where the chalk-white arrows go, for the children, they mark, and the
        children, they know, <a href="/second.html">the place where the sidewalk
        ends</a>.
