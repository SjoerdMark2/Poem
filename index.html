    <h1>Where the sidewalk ends</h1>

    <p class="yellow">
      There is a place where the sidewalk ends
      and before the street begins,
      and there the grass grows soft and white,
      and there the sun burns crimson bright,
      and there the moon-bird rests from his flight
      to cool in the peppermint wind.

      Let us leave this place where the smoke blows black
      and the dark street winds and bends.
      Past the pits where the asphalt flowers grow
      we shall walk with a walk that is measured and slow
      and watch where the chalk-white arrows go
      to the place where the sidewalk ends.

      Yes we'll walk with a walk that is measured and slow,
      and we'll go where the chalk-white arrows go,
      for the children, they mark, and the children, they know,
      <a href="/second.html">the place where the sidewalk ends</a>.
    </p>
